# Topic-Modeling-on-News-Articles
Topic Modeling and NLP project on BBC News

# Project Title : Extraction/identification of major topics & themes discussed in news articles.

# 1) Problem Description

In this project your task is to identify major themes/topics across a collection of BBC news articles. You can use clustering algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) etc.

# 2) Data Description
The dataset contains a set of news articles for each major segment consisting of business, entertainment, politics, sports and technology. You need to create an aggregate dataset of all the news articles and perform topic modeling on this dataset. Verify whether these topics correspond to the different tags available.

# 3) Data Cleaning
Removed stop words and punctuation from tha data with the help of stemming and lematization we got the main word.

# 4) Topic visualization
After removing stop words and apply stemming, vectorised each word to visualize various topics with the help of LDA. With we conculude that after applying grid search with LDA with range (5,10) we get our final 5 topics.

# 5) Model Implementation
After implementing various models on the given data such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Naïve Bays Classifier, KNN Classifier, Random Forest Classifier. We get maximum accuracy with KNN classifier and Logistic regression with train and test accuracy as

• KNN Classifier Train accuracy: 0.96, Teat accuracy: 0.95

• Logistic Regression Train accuracy: 0.98, Test accuracy: 0.95

• As per the working of KNN classifier we would like implement it on News classification.

# 6) Conculsion
The news is almost every second used in different sources of media in soft and hard.

Due to impact of social media everyone is referring to online news platform. News classification became important aspect.

We get maximum accuracy with KNN classifier and Logistic regression with train and test accuracy as 0.96,0.95 and 0.98,0.95 respectively.

As per the working of KNN classifier we would like implement it on News classification.
